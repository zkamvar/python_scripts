Python Scripts
==========

This is simply a repository for me to practice writing python scripts.
None of these scripts come with any warranty. 

## Scripts

 - `rename_files.py`
 	- a script to rename files given a separation pattern and name.
 - `R_function_graph.py`
 	- This will eventually return a graph of all functions utilized in a given
 	R package.
